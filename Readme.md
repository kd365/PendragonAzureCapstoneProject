Background

   GMU The Center for Assurance Research and Engineering (CARE) is developing an Information Environment Assessment project for NATO named Project Merlin led by our project partners. Our capstone objective is a DevSecOps pilot to migrate a locally hosted solution such as Project Merlin’s IEA to a cloud environment. Azure was chosen specifically because NATO maintains a production software development environment called NATO Software Factory which is based on Microsoft’s Azure cloud-based environment. 

Problem Space

  As adoption of social media has grown tremendously over the last several years, organizations are increasingly adopting narrative analysis to use this data to assess public opinion about their organization or a topic that is relevant to the organization. The use cases of this is limitless including strategy, marketing, sales etc. Maybe they want to know how people are reacting to their latest change or announcement, maybe they want to assess the organization’s public image or marketing strategy. 

  Such narrative analysis tools work with extensive amount of data in near real time. Hosting these systems in a cloud environment makes them scalable and gives access to higher computing and processing power.

Problem Statement and Goal

  The goal of this project is to explore the best methods through which to deploy a cost-effective systems architecture utilizing Microsoft Azure in order to perform opinion mining. This project, which includes social media data ingestion, storage, analysis, and visualization, will compare iterations of proposed architecture and provide a recommendation to individuals attempting to convert local data analytic capabilities to a cloud environment.
