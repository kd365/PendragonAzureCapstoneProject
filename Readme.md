The goal of this project is to explore the best methods through which to deploy a cost-effective systems architecture utilizing 
Microsoft Azure in order to perform opinion mining. This project, which includes social media data ingestion, storage, analysis,
and visualization, will compare iterations of proposed architecture and provide a recommendation to individuals attempting to 
convert local data analytic capabilities to a cloud environment.
